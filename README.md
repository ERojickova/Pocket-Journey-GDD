# Pocket-Journey-GDD
## Game Summary
This 
The player plays as a little elf, who is trapped in a coat pocket. He discovers that there is a hole which leads to the bottom of the coat and he has a long journey ahead of him to get out.
## Core Mechanics
* **Crafting** - The player can collect some objects on the way and craft certain things from them.
* **'Puzzle'** - To continue on the journey it is necessary to use the right object at the right time.
* **Boss** - At the end of each part (not just one level, but more) there will be a boss. The fight will be more like a puzzle style rather them combat. 
## Gameplay
The player moves using **WASD** in a 2D platform world, and can collect objects by clicking on them. The player's inventory is displayed at the top of the screen. Crafting involves dragging objects from the inventory and combining them.

The game is divided into several levels, and once a player moves from one level to the next, they cannot go back. Additionally, if the player needs an item from a previous level, they won't be able to leave the previous level without it. At the end of each level, there is a 'door' that automatically moves the player forward; there is no GUI indicating that the level has been completed. The game is designed to feel like one continuous journey. Levels act as checkpoints to prevent the player from having to retrace long sections of the game.
