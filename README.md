# Pocket Journey GDD
## Game Summary
The game is a 2D adventure where the player controls a small elf who has fallen into the pocket of a coat. The objective is to navigate through the inside of the coat, find a way through a hole in the pocket, and eventually reach another pocket. Throughout the game, players will encounter various everyday objects, which serve as obstacles or challenges due to the elf's small size. Players will need to solve puzzles by collecting items and combining them to craft new tools or solutions, turning ordinary pocket contents into unique gameplay elements.
## Core Mechanics
* **Crafting** - Crafting is done by dragging items from the inventory and combining them. Only certain combinations will successfully create new items, but the player won't know the recipes.
* **Puzzle** - Solving puzzles that allow the player to continue their journey and determine which items to use to overcome obstacles. 
* **Boss** - There will be a boss at the end of each section, which includes multiple levels. These encounters will focus more on puzzle-solving than direct combat, with the player dealing damage to the boss indirectly.
## Gameplay
The player moves using **WASD** in a 2D platform world, and can collect objects by clicking on them. The player's inventory is displayed at the top of the screen. Crafting involves dragging objects from the inventory and combining them.

The game is divided into several levels, and once a player moves from one level to the next, they cannot go back. Additionally, if the player needs an item from a previous level, they won't be able to leave the previous level without it. At the end of each level, there is a 'door' that automatically moves the player forward; no GUI indicates that the level has been completed. The game is designed to feel like one continuous journey. Levels act as checkpoints to prevent the player from having to retrace long sections of the game.

## Art style
The art style of this game is a combination of collage and hand-drawn elements. The background is a collage of several different materials, resembling patchwork made from various patterned fabrics and old paper. The interactive objects are simple black-line art that pops up on the background collage so that the player can distinguish them easily. The collectable items are a combination of both styles, a photo of an existing object with a black outline. The inventory will be drawn in the black-line art style and located on the edge of the screen so that it won't interfere with the game.
